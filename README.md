Automated Crypto Wallet & VASP Attribution System

 📌 Overview

This project is a Blockchain Intelligence Platform designed to help Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) investigate suspicious cryptocurrency wallets.

When investigators find a crypto wallet involved in fraud, ransomware, scams, or money laundering, it can be difficult to identify which Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) or crypto exchange is connected to that wallet.

Our system automatically analyzes blockchain transactions and traces the movement of funds to identify the nearest known VASP, exchange, or custodial wallet service.

🎯 Problem

A suspicious crypto wallet may send funds through several intermediate wallets before reaching a crypto exchange.

For example:
Suspect Wallet
      ↓
   Wallet A
      ↓
   Wallet B
      ↓
Exchange Deposit Wallet
      ↓
     VASP

Finding this connection manually can take a lot of time and requires specialized blockchain knowledge.

💡 Proposed Solution:

Our platform automates this process by:

* Taking a suspicious wallet address as input.
* Fetching blockchain transaction data through APIs.
* Tracing the movement of cryptocurrency.
* Identifying connected wallets and transaction paths.
* Detecting known exchange/VASP wallet addresses.
* Providing a confidence score for the identified VASP.
* Showing fund movement using a visual transaction graph.
* Generating an investigation-ready report.

🌐 Supported Blockchains

The system is designed to support multiple major blockchain networks, including:

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Tron
* BNB Chain
* Solana
* Polygon
* Other supported blockchain networks

🔑 Key Features

 1. Wallet Investigation:
Enter a suspicious wallet address and analyze its blockchain activity.

 2.  Transaction Tracing:
Automatically trace transactions through multiple intermediate wallets.

 3. VASP Identification:
Identify exchanges, custodial wallets, deposit addresses, and other VASPs connected to the transaction flow.

4. Confidence Scoring:
Provide a confidence score to indicate how strongly the wallet is associated with a suspected VASP.

 5.  Transaction Graph:
Visualize how funds move from the suspicious wallet to other wallets and VASPs.

6. Risk Analysis:
Help identify potentially high-risk wallets and suspicious transaction patterns.

7. Investigation Reports:
Generate structured reports containing wallet addresses, transactions, fund movement, identified VASPs, and analysis results.

8. SAHYOG Integration:
The platform is designed to integrate with the **SAHYOG ecosystem** through APIs to support lawful information disclosure and asset-freezing workflows.
